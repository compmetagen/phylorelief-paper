Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Forl	M12Forl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F1	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	popliteal fossa

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F13Knee	F13Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Knel	M11Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Forr	F31Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Knel	M42Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Knel	F32Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis.

We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M53Knee	M53Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	60	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Kner	F32Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Forr	F12Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Kner	M32Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Kner	M11Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Kner	F22Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Forl	F12Forl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	volar forearm

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Forr	M22Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Kner	F21Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F33Knee	F33Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen). Assays were carried out using 5-10 _l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 _l in black, 96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader using the 480/520-nm excitation/emission filter pair. Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F3	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	popliteal fossa
